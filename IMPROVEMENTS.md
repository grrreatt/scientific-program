# Scientific Program Application Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the major improvements made to the scientific program application to enhance user experience, accessibility, and functionality.

## 1. Session Creation/Editing Modal

### Features Implemented:
- **Centered Modal Popup**: Session add/edit form now opens in a centrally positioned modal (560px max width) instead of separate pages
- **Visual Design**: Rounded corners, soft shadow, and generous internal spacing for a modern look
- **Scrollable Content**: Modal content is vertically scrollable when it exceeds modal height
- **Sticky Action Buttons**: Save/Cancel buttons are fixed at the bottom and always visible
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility with Tab, Enter, and Escape support
- **Focus Management**: Automatic focus on first form element when modal opens
- **Click Outside to Close**: Modal closes when clicking outside the content area

### Technical Implementation:
- Created reusable `Modal` component with proper accessibility attributes
- Implemented `SessionForm` component for consistent form handling
- Added proper state management for modal open/close and form submission
- Integrated with existing session management logic

## 2. 12-Hour Time Picker

### Features Implemented:
- **Intuitive Interface**: Hour (1-12), minute (00-59), and AM/PM selection
- **Flexible Minutes**: Full 0-59 minute range (not limited to 0/30 intervals)
- **Modern Design**: Resembles mobile alarm clock interface but desktop-friendly
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Natural tab flow through hour → minute → AM/PM → next field
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant conversion between 12-hour display and 24-hour storage format
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to mobile screens with stacked layout

### Technical Implementation:
- Created `TimePicker` component with state management
- Automatic parsing and formatting of time values
- Proper validation and required field handling
- CSS classes for responsive behavior

## 3. Public Program Grid Layout

### Features Implemented:
- **Clean Grid Design**: Columns for each hall/track, rows for time slots
- **Readable Format**: Session blocks show title, time (12-hour format), type, and speakers
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Color-coded session types with subtle, non-garish colors
- **Break Handling**: Breaks and meals clearly shown as distinct categories
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly with proper column collapsing
- **Print Optimization**: Clean print layout with proper spacing and readability

### Technical Implementation:
- Redesigned public program page with CSS Grid layout
- Enhanced session type color coding with better contrast
- Improved time formatting for 12-hour display
- Added comprehensive print styles
- Optimized for both screen and print viewing

## 4. Enhanced User Experience

### Performance Improvements:
- **No Page Reloads**: All session operations handled client-side
- **Instant Updates**: Changes reflected immediately in the schedule
- **Skeleton Loading**: Loading states for better perceived performance
- **Optimized Animations**: Smooth modal transitions and focus states

### Accessibility Enhancements:
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for all interactions
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
